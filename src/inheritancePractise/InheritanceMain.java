/*
* Inheritance is a concept that we can produce subclasses(lowclass) from a base class(upperclass).
 ***********************************************************
 * WE MUST CREATE AN OBJECT TO USE INHERITED CLASS METHODS *
 ***********************************************************
* we can inherit field(variables) and methods from the base class.
* If we want to modify one inherited class in the sub-class we need to specificy @Override before change the method
* Each sub-class can have specific other methods than base class
* ENCAPSULATION -> BAse class fields should be private in order to protect our class info, only methods should be public and accessible
* POLYMORPHISM -> diversity of the objects for example we can create a Woman object with Human reference.
