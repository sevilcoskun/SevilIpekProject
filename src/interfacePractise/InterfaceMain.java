/* Interface is a concept that we can design of our system from a base class
 *************************************************************
 * WE CANNOT CREATE AN OBJECT TO USE INTERFACE CLASS METHODS *
 *************************************************************
 * Interface class has just signature of each functions(WITHOUT BODY)
 * in every produced sub-class needs to implement that class and its methods(without body methods should be filled with body in sub-classes)
 * POLYMORPHISM is also used in interface classes as well
 * Interfaces are useful to provide stability of our code, for example if in the future there should be added a new sub-class,
 * we dont need to discover the world from the beginning, when we implement interface, it suggest us fill that methods
